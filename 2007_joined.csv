Coming from a Portuguez family who really only speaks portuguez I have made my ways through school and made my parents proud of me.  I work hard everyday to acheive my goals of becoming a Nurse. Currently I am working full time as an assistant Nurse. I believe every individual should have goals set in there life because I believe that is what keeps you on track.   Reason For Loan Request: Both my parents were born in Portugal so there English is not so good. They have had rough times getting a job but eventually they both got one. My father is a construction worker and my mom works at A Child Day Care. There income is not that strong but they do what they have to do to get by. They worked hard to pay for me to go through college to get my associates. Now that I have had this assistant Nursing job for over a year now I feel it is time to start paying them back. Along with paying them back I also want to buy a used car so I can stop putting miles and trapping them in the house by using there car. I also want a little helping hand paying for school that will be coming up and books that will be coming up soon.  Closing Remarks: I want to Thank everyone who has taken the time to read my request for a Loan. I can guarentee you 100% that this Loan will be repayed in time and on time. I will not let anyone down and I will definatly not let my self down. Please give me the helping hand on trying to achieve my goal of becoming a Nurse. This Loan will also improve my credit score. As of now I do not mind the high interest rate because I believe anyone out there that has that warm heart to help me out should be rewarded with some profit.

I do want to have a good credit history.  I so far have been managing well but If I could consolidate my balances I\'d be better off. I recently broke my leg and was on disability for four months which really threw me off track finacially. Since I haven\'t had credit for too long & I don\'t have a very high salary I can\'t get a loan without a co-signer and my single parent won\'t co-sign for me. She is afraid I will not be able to pay the loans back. Plus I also help her out financially. I know I can payoff a loan easily. I can afford up to 500 or more dollars to pay toward one bill. My issue is my bills are so spread out I end up paying all of them daily all at once and am constantly broke & struggling till my next check. I am trying my very best here guys but I need help. I have even decided to take some time off school to try & work extra to pay down my debt because I am very stressed by it. Someone please help, I will not let you down. I will pay up ! I don\'t want to ruin my credit and thats exactly why I am trying to take responsibility and get my situation under better control before it\'s our of control.

With the new mortgage (and all the other bills that come with our home), we have found ourselves over our head in debt.  We are in dire need of assistance to maintain the life we have been steadily building for our family. Our income and debt are as follows:  I have been an auto tech for nearly 3 years with the same employer.  This year, I was promoted to manager, which, helped us realize our dream of homeownership.  My wife works part time as a CSR at the same company.   I earn 60k/annually My wife $17k Average Net monthly income: $4500  Our monthly debts:  Mortage $1120.00 Vehichle:$639.00 Credit Card: $100.00 Credit Card: $ 89.00 Short term Personal Loan: $150.00 Short term Personal Loan: $190.00 Car insurance: $125.00 Utilities:  $300.00 Cell Phones: $80.00 Gas: $300.00 Food:$600.00 (with tons of coupons) Daycare: $120/wk  With this loan we intend to pay off the two personal loans.  This will give clear at least $340 a month! This is a big deal to us.  This will be our first step in a series towards reducing our debt.  All of our bills have ALWAYS been paid on time and remain current.  My credit profile is being penalized because I have never had much credit. We are honest, loving, and giving people.

I am still paying my bills on time but it is very hard to keep up due to finance charges and interests added up.I would like to pay all of these debts at one time and then cancel out Merrick, Chase and Sears, and only keep one credit card, meantime pay only one loan,one interest.

I\'m a recently engaged, hardworking professional in my mid-20\'s who is trying to start a new life with my partner, but several roadblocks have come up along the way.  I have always been a very honest, do-it-myself kind of person. Growing up in a lower middle class family, I worked and supported myself all throughout high school and college.   I currently work as a program director at a nonprofit organization that provides clinical, legal, and shelter services to domestic violence victims. It is a salaried position with full benefits (but the salary is at a typical nonprofit level). My partner is an artist/illustrator. We both work very hard and do not have a lavish lifestyle at all. We\'ve tried to be frugal and save, but my partner recently had some legal, automobile, and medical costs to pay for which wiped out our savings.  My partner has sold the car, I have taken on a freelance job in addition to my full-time job, and now we are looking to move to a cheaper apartment as well as eventually get married. A loan of $10,000 would allow us to pay the last month\'s rent on the current apartment, pay for the security/first/last on a new, more affordable apartment, pay for moving expenses (we do not have much furniture or possessions), pay off my partner\'s legal and medical expenses, and maybe set aside some for our new life together.  I\'m not proud to be requesting money from strangers because I\'ve always tried to work my way through life and figure things out, but the situation has just become so tough and desperate with the fact I need to support my partner, and I would do anything for us to have a life together. Moving to a cheaper apartment and paying off the unexpected legal, automobile, and medical expenses will allow us to better manage our income and get back on our feet, and our top priority would be paying back this loan.  Also, I\'m not quite sure how this process works as I\'ve never done it before, but we currently live in New York but I was originally based in New Jersey, so that is why my location indicates New Jersey (we may also end up moving to New Jersey due to the more affordable rent).

I am a successful software engineer with 10 years experience, 5 in a big corporation, 5 as a consultant.  I have a full time consulting position but I run an additional side consulting business in a different market and therefore do not compete with my employer.  This loan will pay for lead generation and conversion, marketing materials, and escrow for subcontractors.  After many months of research and study I have determined the best ways to scale my side consulting business using less of my time and efforts.  I will expand through referral systems, passive income products such as information products and software components, and outsourcing development to qualified teams in India, Russia, etc.  My financial situation:  Don\'t be alarmed by my high revolving balances.  It is essentially a wash.  Whenever I receive a 0% introductory rate on a credit line, I take the money and write out-of-the-money uncovered puts at 30% equity in my brokerage account.  When the introductory rate is close to expiration, I pay the credit line back.  Unlike this loan, the good rates typically only last 6 months.  I have strong character and uphold all my obligations.  I have never missed a payment in my life. This includes the 18 month period when I had a parent near death with cancer surgeries, had my first child with my wife after being cheated out of health insurance ($50,000 loss there even though we\'re all perfectly healthy and had a perfect delivery), moved from one state to another, and sold two houses (I owned a rental property).

We had a lot of mold damage (from tremendous water leakage). Unfortunately, insurance does not cover mold damage in Florida any longer. As a result, we went through our savings and used a lot of credit to repair our home. I had never been through anything quite so devasting and have developed a real sympathy for anyone facing a disaster! We lost so much that can never be replaced.   A lot of the repairs we did ourselves to save money but certain things we were not qualified to do- i.e. electircal, roofing,etc. We have just now this summer gotten a new roof (the waiting lists were over 18 months long). We are now ready to complete the electrical issues, new ceilings and put our house back in order. We are out of money and need help!  I am a local banker who has lived and worked in the community for over 25 years. I am very active in giving back to the community and hope some of that good karma will come back to me now that I need some help. My credit is good- I have no late payments, collections, judgements, cahrgeoffs, etc. My score is not high since I have used a great deal of credit to try to put my home back together, but I ALWAYS pay my bills. I can afford the payment, and am a person of high moral character.   Please let me know if there is any other information that would like to know.

I have a steady job that I\'ve had for the past 2 and a half years, and I expect to have this job until we decide to move someplace else (5 years or so down the road).

I have two contracts in place through my business. The first contract was signed on September 4, 2007. It is a marketing referral and confidentiality agreement with a mortgage origination company. There are 2 components to the agreement: I am authorized to refer developer/realtor contacts to the firm and receive 1/3 of any origination fees generated by the origination firm from these contacts. The firm currently works with 1 developer I referred and I have passed along 3 more in the last week. The second component involves selling the current inventory of mortgage loans the origination company carries and services. I have negotiated a broker fee of $75,000 for the sale of a $5M portfolio. I have a commitment to purchase that requires an SEC filing for securitizing the portfolio (attorney\'s fees required), negotiating the final purchase price (travel required), and generating the final agreement in legal form to complete the transaction (attorney\'s fees required).  The second contract was agreed upon today and provides me with a $100,000 fee for procuring funding for a custom home development. On November 16 the contract will be signed and a $10,000 escrow deposit made to secure the contract. I then have 90 days to procure the funding. I already have 2 investor groups interested and am setting up presentation meetings with those groups for sometime in early December. I am responsible for developing the investor presentation, coordinating the date/time for the presentation including booking the meeting room (travel required as well), and generating the final agreement (attorney\'s fees required).

My credit card debt level fluctuates DRAMATICALLY from month to month (I only buy when things are on sale, and I pay everything off as soon as they sell - always within 3 months), which makes conventional financing hard, which is why this seems to be the best solution for me.  If you have any questions please feel free to email me at AnnaCFarney@Yahoo.com. Thank you for your consideration.

I\'ve already cut up the cards so they will just be open credit lines to enhance my credit history when they are paid off.  The extra money I save in interest will go towards paying for my colleges classes.  I was accepted to Indiana University\'s distance learning program and want to focus on finishing my last year of college and paying down debt the next year(I left school to for a tech job in the mid 90\'s)     I\'m employed by Washington state as a computer systems administrator/supervisor.

These debts are purchased for 3%-5% of the debt value by my company and completely followed through on via lawsuit, judgment, and execution of the judgment (payment/wage garnishment of the debt). Most collection agencies boast of a 30%-60% return by simply sending out intimidating letters and phone calls. They are simply too large of an operation and have too many accounts to file suit on all of them. By purchasing smaller batches of debts and going through the full legal process, I am able to receive a return of 60%-90% with almost no office expenses.  I have been working for a collection company (US Credit Corp.) for over 3 years collecting taxes and debts, as well as doing work in their legal department. I am well-versed in multi-State collection law, as well as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  These loan funds will be used exclusively to purchase debts and to pay the filing fee associated with each lawsuit.  The combination of my business only being in existence for a few months and the fact that banks don\'t like to lend on intangible items, makes for a difficult bank-borrowing experience. I tend to pay things off early and pay for things in cash, so I don\'t have a very lengthy credit history, however my credit scores are still very good. I live on my father\'s estate, so my living expenses are almost nothing. My only real expenses are my car, food, and the rare occasion that I stop thinking about work and go out and have some fun :) I have 2 credit cards and a small car loan, all of which have never seen a late payment.

A women\'s clothing boutique is being sold close to where we live.  This is a great location as it is across the street from a middle school and sandwiched between a brand new neighborhood and a developing neighborhood.  It is being sold because the seller has 2 other businesses and is unable to grow & manage this boutique to achieve profitability quicker.  Though there will be seller financing, a down payment is expected and we will need some extra money to act as a buffer for intangibles.  The Good: We tend to quickly increase profitability by lowering some of the overhead costs.  We intend to sell retail as well as act as a broker for those looking to make high end specialty purchases.  We will develop the website so that it will serve as a social networking site that will allow us to take input from shoppers who are looking for unique fashions.  Items will be sold on the site, and overstock items will be directed to overseas markets.  We intend to keep inventories fairly low.  My income is sufficient to cover extra problems that may arise.  My wife is not working and will manage & grow the business full time.  The Bad: This is retail and it may not be profitable for at least 6 months (thats not your problem though....).  The customer base is undeveloped and we will need to do a significant amount of marketing to build it.  This should not be too big a problem though as my wife is a recent MBA grad.  The Ugly: I\'m in grad school and my loans will come calling by the end of summer in 08.  Since my last personal loan I have not defaulted or been late with any payments, but I have gotten more credit cards and have increased my available balances on all of them very recently; this may be a why it has gone down.  Also, I\'ve gone from W2 employee to 1099 contractor (no taxes hoooray!), the uncertainty of self employment may have altered the grade as well.   About Me: I am a DBA working in the Atlanta Metro area.  I am also an investor in a few other things as well such as ATMs and P2P lending.

We never intended to get into so much debt, but over the past four years, we\'ve sunk deeper and deeper. First, my wife was laid off two weeks before Christmas. During that same week, our only car died, and we got a $300 gas bill. So we lived off of a line of credit. Then, I was laid off, so we lived off of a credit card. As the bills piled up, we kept relying on our credit to buy necessities.   Now we\'re both working again, but it doesn\'t seem to be enough. One of our interest rates is over 19%, and it\'s killing us. We pay everything on time, and usually much more than the minimum payment. Consolidating our three credit payments will help us get out of debt faster than continuing to pay the credit card companies.  Between the two of us, we take home roughly $4000 a month. After the utilities, house payment and other bills, we will have roughly $500 a month to pay towards this loan.  Getting out of debt would mean being able to add to our family. Getting out of debt would mean buying a house of our own instead of splitting one with my mom. Getting out of debt would mean everything to us- help out this young family!
